\description{
A covered put is the bearish equivalent of a covered call. It is achieved by short-selling the underlying stock and writing an equivalent put against it. By writing a put against a short sale, the trader is now in the position to buy the stock, if exercised, when the market price fell below the putâ€™s strike price. The covered put writer is, in effect, forgoing the opportunity to participate in the decrease in stock price under the strike price in exchange for premium received for selling the put for the same (Kakushadze & Serur, 2018).

\details{
According to conceptual details given by Cohen (2015), and a closed-form solution provided by Kakushadze and Serur (2018), this method is developed, and the given examples are created, to display the Initial Value as Net Credit (V0Cr) per share or unit of the underlying for Covered Put. EXAMPLE, Short HypoGamma stock at $20.00 (inflow) and short HypoGamma December 18 call at $2.00 (inflow).
